1455178967539986437	109187903	 Fair, but I wonder if you could achieve more control over the torment side of things. I eat out, hit most of my goals, and don’t torment myself. Maybe I set smaller goals though? If I was bodybuilding I couldn’t eat out. But lots of eating disorders are called bodybuilding.	0
1455178076241936386	109187903	 I think you and I are generally agreed, but I do think it’s possible to eat out and still be healthy and hit goals. The problem with saying it “doesn’t work” is that many people will resign their goals after eating out a lot, often because it’s out of their control.	0
1455177285632471041	109187903	 I eat out probably ~0 meals a week, but I don’t think it’s net worse. I don’t get baked good, I order salads/vegetable dishes with lots of grilled chicken, and add pretty conservative guesses for dressings/sauces. + for things like butter. It can definitely be done IMO	0
1455174452908597249	109187903	 Living in the west village and maintaining a social life (friends and dating) makes cooking every meal pretty impractical, unfortunately. I do think it’s okay to eat out, you just have to control yourself and think about inputs	2
1455169192622166029	109187903	 Lastly, and this was the biggest issue: anything that I couldn’t weigh or find on my MFP became a guilty pleasure. Eating out with friends? A cocktail w/ unknown proportions on a date? Suddenly I was always worried about / obsessing over food. My diet improved, but at what cost?	2
