1243298450223042561	1206276425558319104	 Right... it’s a sad situation to be in. I definitely do think it’s a necessary thing to do bc no one will stay home if they’re still able to go out and buy food from restaurants. I think all retails store should’ve closed by now as well	2

1243296164293816320	1206276425558319104	 Mmmm then I stand by what I say. All restaurants should close and all employees should be paid while not working. It’s hard trying to keep everyone home if they’re still going out to buy food. Even if it’s pickup/delivery it’s still unsafe!	0
