1375995559815737345	32516816	  I wouldn’t feel judged 😂 when I go to Chile to visit my mom I’ll eat her tuna croquettes. Once in a long while I’ll eat a (clean - scales and fins)“fried fish” if we go out to a restaurant cause there’s not many options for vegetarians. But I haven’t been there in a yr 🙄 	2
