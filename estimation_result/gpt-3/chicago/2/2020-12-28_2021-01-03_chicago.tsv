1343680949037445121	2933640214	 Great Stuff Abby, I agree with going to the gym and waking up a bit earlier to give yourself that extra time to tidy up. Organization is key. I also find that going to the gym in the morning, you are more focused for the rest of the day. Also prayer is good during that time.	0

1343471374690562050	584206382	Just finished season 0, episode 0 of my X-File rewatch “Travelers.” A flashback episode to two years before the show proper began, with Mulder interviewing former agent Arthur Dales (Darren McGavin!) and Mulder is wearing a wedding ring. How did I not notice this before?	0
1343432839497453568	175186392	 I went to church and sat with my friend’s family. We did air high fives instead of shaking hands. I then carpooled to a charity event where over 0 people worked closely to pack food. We wore hair nets and gloves but no masks. I worked two more days before my office closed.	2

The real challenge is you often don’t know they are positive until later—this is why gathering is risky -&gt;you need to consider your risk of exposure as it’s often not zero.	2

1345025227793825795	1244646119176638464	Happy New Year. If you attended a gathering, we do need your help to prevent a post-holiday surge. The BEST way to limit transmission is still to quarantine for 0 days and get tested 0 to 0 days after gathering. See below if you can’t do that. 	2
1345380353196904449	14673926	 I like these players a lot! But my mum spend Christmas on her fucking own because we’re in the middle of a pandemic. The stupidity of taking part in this gathering is staggering, forget promoting it. If the league gets shut down, it will be because of behavior like this.	2
1345819244626382849	1288947149137416196	 I am very sad to see you spreading this kind of fear. Firstly, simply following gathering guidelines. Secondly, there is no information given here-impossible to verify what happened. Thirdly, simply sign a waiver you wont use the hospitals if you catch it and need help.	2
