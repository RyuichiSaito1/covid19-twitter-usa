1437427641250897928	100093426	  Listen, idk why people thought sending kids back to school during the pandemic was going to work out fine and the city/district was going to have every problem solved when they never have before. This isn't even about the wellbeing of students and families.	2
1437395222984597505	20440293	 Your kids go to school on Saturday? 	2
1437393417751965697	29905725	ok but hear me out: do i *have* to go to work today?	2
1437384593087283203	225719042	 I am but it be too much going on outside so I just stay home. I’m a mother so going out all the time isn’t my thing nor being around a bunch of mf’s like that. I step out when I can but be ready to go home🤷🏽‍♀️	2
1437375809837309960	1601568144	  So what should I do? Never Ever leave my house? Never Ever go out with people? Never Ever go to a restaurant? I’m going to live my life. I was vaccinated, too bad if others aren’t. That’s not my problem. You get vaccinated so you are protected. CAPEESH?	2
1437352777475366919	1601568144	 I’m vaccinated. If I’m sick I stay home. If I’m well I go to work. Why would I ever get a test? If you tell me I may be an asymptomatic carrier, then I should get tested every single day of the week. Getting tested makes no sense, if I’m vaccinated and feeling well.	0
