I eat out, hit most of my goals, and don’t torment myself. Maybe I set smaller goals though? If I was bodybuilding I couldn’t eat out.

The problem with saying it “doesn’t work” is that many people will resign their goals after eating out a lot, often because it’s out of their control.	{'place_id': '01a9a39529b27f36'}
