3146710555	2020-04-19T08:09:56.000Z	1251785089135947777	GOING TO SCHOOL ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN DAYTONA BEACH, FL HAS BEEN THE BEST DECISION I’VE MADE. I learned how to be comfortable with being alone. I stepped way out of my comfort zone, left everything I love, family, friends, & old relationships. Learned sacrifice will get me far 💲	{'place_id': '7ad2e48aebe2e3ea'}

It is sooooo surreal seeing the freeways so empty. Even though I didn’t leave the car, going “out” to see other sights felt so nice.	{'place_id': '3b77caf94bfc81fe'}
