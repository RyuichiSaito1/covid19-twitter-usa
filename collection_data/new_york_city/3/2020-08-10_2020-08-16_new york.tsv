For a moment they aren't international superstars. They're just a group of friends having fun on a trip and taking  along.  	{'place_id': '011add077f4d2da3'}
2020-08-11T14:01:51.000Z	1293185865640902656	Never book a flight with Royal Air Maroc. It should not be taking me this long to get a refund on a trip that’s obviously not happening and that I booked pre-COVID. Totally unacceptable.	{'place_id': '00c55f041e27dc51'}
2020-08-11T02:20:14.000Z	1293009300957343744	  As an Eminem fan but also a Kendrick fan, Eminem took a lot of us on a trip TO sobriety, not from it. His music resonates on a different level. He can’t deliver the pain Kendrick does because his pain was from poverty and being abused by the little he had in life. Don’t compare.	{'place_id': '011add077f4d2da3'}
