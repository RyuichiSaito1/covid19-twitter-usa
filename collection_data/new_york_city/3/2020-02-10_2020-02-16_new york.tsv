Took me a month to see my GP - ended up using that appointment for the follow up to emergency surgery instead.

It's confirmed that I cannot travel in between regions of Chugoku and Kansai for Hiroko's gig so it's best to stay in Kansai especially going to Great Blue live house.	{'place_id': '01a9a39529b27f36'}
