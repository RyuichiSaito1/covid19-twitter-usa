2020-07-04T20:36:20.000Z	1279514404514652160	I feel like fireworks should be completely legal by train tracks and plane landing paths. You don't like there if you or your dogs are noise sensitive.	{'place_id': '777dd5b3b30a625e'}
2020-07-05T21:07:18.000Z	1279884582851149831	  To me: “b/c some ppl don’t wear masks & don’t social distance.” Small groups r dangerous.  Men die at higher rate than infected Women. How did these NYers think this was OK? How many commuted from Manhattan? By bus? By train? Who will still be alive in 0 days?	{'place_id': '1e11d8be00564690'}
