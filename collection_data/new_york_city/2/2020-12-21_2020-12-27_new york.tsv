I was celebrating Christmas Eve with my stepmom and stepsister. 🎄 Very small gathering this year as opposed to having 0 to 0 people that we usually have. Merry Christmas Paul and to Kate and your family. 🎅 	{'place_id': '0ae73f36fd07fca0'}

The Q is whether it’s appropriate for them to be prohibited	{'place_id': '01a9a39529b27f36'}

There is a federally mandated program gathering data.	{'place_id': '011add077f4d2da3'}
