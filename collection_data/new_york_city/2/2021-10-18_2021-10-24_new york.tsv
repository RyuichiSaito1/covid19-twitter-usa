2021-10-20T00:20:15.000Z	1450617824544702468	 You just mentioned the murder of Kitty Genovese. She was a family member through marriage. I only met her once, as a small child at a family gathering in New Canaan, Ct.  Thank you for bringing her into an extremely fitting monologue. God Bless you and yours. 🙏🏻🐘	{'place_id': '011add077f4d2da3'}
