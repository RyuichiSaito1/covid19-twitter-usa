2021-11-01T14:24:36.000Z	1455178967539986437	 Fair, but I wonder if you could achieve more control over the torment side of things. I eat out, hit most of my goals, and don’t torment myself. Maybe I set smaller goals though? If I was bodybuilding I couldn’t eat out. But lots of eating disorders are called bodybuilding.	{'place_id': '01a9a39529b27f36'}
2021-11-01T14:21:03.000Z	1455178076241936386	 I think you and I are generally agreed, but I do think it’s possible to eat out and still be healthy and hit goals. The problem with saying it “doesn’t work” is that many people will resign their goals after eating out a lot, often because it’s out of their control.	{'place_id': '01a9a39529b27f36'}

I don’t get baked good, I order salads/vegetable dishes with lots of grilled chicken, and add pretty conservative guesses for dressings/sauces. + for things like butter.
