I also find that going to the gym in the morning, you are more focused for the rest of the day. Also prayer is good during that time.	{'place_id': '2180fafeb49b5684'}

The real challenge is you often don’t know they are positive until later—this is why gathering is risky -&gt;you need to consider your risk of exposure as it’s often not zero.	{'place_id': '1d9a5370a355ab0c'}
