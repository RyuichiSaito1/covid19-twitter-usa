Our school leaders care about bringing our students and staff back to school to a safe environment.  	{'place_id': '92e012db736d72c5'}

Trump just talks bullshit, lies, and encourages people to go out into crowds which is basically telling them to kill themselves because they could get fatally ill, or they will spread it to those who are only out to get food/true essentials.
