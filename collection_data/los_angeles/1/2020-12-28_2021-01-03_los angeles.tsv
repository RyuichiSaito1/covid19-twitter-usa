Go out empty-handed when it comes to should-haves and could-have-beens. Because it’s an infinitely more fulfilling way to live than the alternative.	{'place_id': '3b77caf94bfc81fe'}

Use the hell out of it. At the end of your life go out with a bruised up, worn out heart that gave too much and loved too strongly & felt too fiercely.	{'place_id': '3b77caf94bfc81fe'}

Most of us were born into citizenship and didn’t actually have to work at it.
