1228196062956937216	919266656	 im being completely honest with you i agree with everything you’re saying. all im saying is bernie sanders isn’t the answer. trying to win the general election while pushing the socialism juice on the country isn’t going to work. you and i both know this.	2
1228194846742958101	919266656	      and to further my point if bernie is in the general election vs trump it will be very hard for bernie to win over moderate democrats and independent swing voters in purple states and southern states when he is coming out on TV saying he’s a socialist. it isn’t going to work.	2
