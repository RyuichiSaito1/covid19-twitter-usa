1245525755574071298	9213492	Now we have to do the opposite: stay further away. Don’t reach out, don’t go out. Don’t seek community; keep your distance. We hate that because in a crisis we’re meant to shed that veil of distance immediately. That’s the rule. Not this time, and it’s been driving me nuts.	2
1245524963823665158	26422595	 Scary that the end of Feb 0, 0- you were still encouraging your constituents to visit Chinatown, restaurants, etc. Telling them to go out! You also ignored the reality that the lack of urgency to fill American's pockets was due to your focus on impeachment.	2
