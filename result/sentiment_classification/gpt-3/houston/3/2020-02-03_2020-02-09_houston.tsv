1226191127172304898	948926066	 I moved away from home & have lived a lot of places, so it usually involves travel to get to multiple events & I’ll always insist on paying for bride’s portion of bachelorette party if I’m financially able to. But my friends are amazing & generous and that goes both ways with us.	2
1226190515621769216	948926066	But even in a wedding where bride paid for our hair, makeup, dresses, shoes & hotel rooms at the wedding venue I spent more than $0 for travel, bachelorette party, gifts, etc. I was happy to do it so this isn’t a complaint. Just saying $0 isn’t altogether outrageous.	0
