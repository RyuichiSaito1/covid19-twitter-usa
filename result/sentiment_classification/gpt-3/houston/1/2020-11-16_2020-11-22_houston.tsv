1330611656024420352	13649232	     Nobody in my family, extended family has gotten covid and all wear masks, social distance.  Despite living in the heart of a city of 0m+ people, we've managed to avoid it despite hearing about so many others we know getting it.  We go out, we're not afraid and we wear masks.  NBD	2
1330610765464625152	13649232	     Why're you opposed to masks, btw?  I get lockdowns, but masks are just so... trivial.  I go out several days a week - I'm at a spa right now - and I never go anywhere without wearing my mask.  It's just so inconsequential for me that the recommendation would have been enough.	0
