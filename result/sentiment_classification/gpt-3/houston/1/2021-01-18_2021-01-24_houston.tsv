1351264697782296576	878495610034425858	 , Dang..y’all should give some kind of break on bag weight limits for College Students going back to school.

1351263217016827904	459669757	  So are u volunteering to pay all of my Bills? You must be. Bcuz now you're telling me not to go to work, or to the store for food, or to get gas to get to work to get the food. Should I miss going to physical therapy appts too? You're such a genius! Idk how I didn't think of that	2
1351249469380177928	3092233730	 Sadly, true. And some of these people still communicate w/ their exes frequently, have sex w/ them, or go out their way to be seen and heard by said ex to make em jealous (I shouldn’t have to say no communication unless you have kids together) but no healing lies in any of that.	2

1351147713396678656	1171669640667369472	   That is easy to say. It’s not true. I went to school full time. I worked full time. I worked the sh*t jobs you work when you don’t have a specific vocation or professional education. If you never reach $0k, it’s because you failed to do the things you needed to do to succeed.	2
1351142075631341573	1171669640667369472	 Don’t confuse them with facts. My 0’s were literally working all night go to school all day.

1351125439113289732	59582687	  Actually no I’m not trolling just as much as you are..!!! All people have choices!!! If they choose to go out they choose to do so. Everyone has their own life to live as they see for. So if YOU choose to live in a bubble and be headed as cattle that’s on you..	0

I’d beg to stay extra hours. My health was so bad and I had no money for anything but the bills. I hate that fucking struggle 🙅🏻‍♀️	2
1351045316083122181	118289772	 So, no one campaigned on 0.They offered $0k.  The Repubs only wanted to give 0. Trump advocated for 0k. Senate refused.

State schools should be far more affordable. No dispute about need to raise minimum wage but more than doubling is a bad idea.	2

1351673026367135745	17399833	The hypocrisy is mind numbing. Are people all “idiots” for going out or not? Are you focusing on yourself or calling strangers out for shit you don’t approve of?
