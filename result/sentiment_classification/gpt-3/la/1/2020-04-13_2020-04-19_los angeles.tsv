1250152609316405248	24803367	  Right? Nobody said this wasn’t a difficult time. But this attitude of privilege is so much worse for a child’s growth and development than a few months off school. And I say this as a parent with a special needs child. Look at Syria, Yemen. These kids never get to go to school.	2
1250148933608681473	1193238975634296832	 We trying to enjoy our time together right now lol we tryna go out to eat have fun and eat some more before we have a little Eddie bugging us to go home loll	0
1250147395565834240	24803367	 I have a MA Ed. In Jewish education. We are not stunting a child’s development. This is overly histrionic. Use this period as an incubator for ideas and creativity. We are lucky our children ever get to go to school. Think of children in Syria. Their struggle is far beyond ours.	2

1250146296008019969	24803367	 I have an autistic child, so I hear you. It’s incredibly difficult. That said: we are a privileged culture. Many children around the world never get to go to school. If we reframe this as coming together to make society safe and healthy, that’s more productive than complaining.	0
