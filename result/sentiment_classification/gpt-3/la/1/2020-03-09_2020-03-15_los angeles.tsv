1239190778515079168	1079042981850603520	There’s so many people going out with coughing children. You weren’t given the two weeks to vacation. Keep your kids indoor safe and HEALTHY. Preparing for a pandemic isn’t just overbuying toilet paper and water.	2
1239188372070907909	377626969	Before you go out read this People who are at higher risk of illness from COVID-0 share messages urging social distancing  	2
1239186237199486976	24070451	 Good morning, Deb. I don’t believe that he’s not infected! So, I’m practicing social distancing today by not going out to Church, but it feels odd. I live with a family that has a 0 year old and mom is concerned for her health as well as mine.....🤷🏼‍♀️	2
1239185126631682048	14109781	 It wasn’t one tweet. In another tweet she was bragging about going out because this is America and it’s her right blah blah. She’s running for elected office. IMHO held to a higher standard.	2
1239183080524374016	600174958	   Avoid going out at all. Conventions/concerts have been postponed or cancelled to possibly return the next year. If the distancing rules are permanent, then these conventions would go under because more space would need to be rented out for same attendees, raising costs.	2
1239181578040782848	47695096	 fed has more than enough power to protect folks jobs/income. i want us to stop acting like they don’t. and like the only ppl out are those that have to go to work. this weekend alone has shown ppl out like nothing is wrong. at malls bars clubs etc just being irresponsible	2

1239126989539139584	2387612868	It's about to be very clear that hourly workers are going to have no choice but be exposed because they don't have the option to stay home, while the toilet paper hoarding upper middle class sit home-ish. Not going to work, but to restaurants & malls & to buy up all the supplies.	2
1239125323259637760	2387612868	Why is  letting malls stay open??? That means we all have to go to work and be trapped with tons of people because our companies can't or won't close. These malls are full. Glendale Galleria food court and mall were packed today. Americana too. Crowds on crowds!	2
1239117864507822086	2309248832	So my calc midterm is tomorrow but I can’t go to school and my teacher hasn’t answered any of my emails all semester or sent one out to update us on our class or midterms soooo	2

1239069186501906432	18015221	  No one is telling bartenders not to go to work and to choose to forego money. Maybe that's the confusion. Bar owners should be paying their employees regardless, and if they can't the government should. No one is getting wasted out of some noble imperative to save service workers	2

1239046342938251266	49370408	 I think the fear is that if things spread and become bad people may not a. want to risk going on bc fear of getting infected or b. not be able to go out where there’s government required quarantine	2
