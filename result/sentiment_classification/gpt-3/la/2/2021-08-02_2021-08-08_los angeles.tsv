1422590769538297862	98450124	 Some don’t. But I’d say on the balance of probabilities, most women want to be with a gentleman and have high standards for what they want on a date. Which I’m not disagreeing with, just curious what ppl think our standards or expectations should be from the male side	2
1422580661131436033	800032782722289665	   I get that, but your health challenges and inability to get the vaccine make you much more vulnerable. Do you really want to risk death to go to a restaurant?	2
1422574335298924545	98450124	 Lol it’s got nothing to do with “ my expectations” but I clearly labeled what most females expect on a date which isn’t bad per say. I’m just curious what should the other half expect. If it’s nothing then I’m guessing it’s more of a one sided exchange	0
1422572673478000646	98450124	I have a genuine question I’d like to ask. As a man on a date for the most part we’re expect to pay, plan, be a gentleman, open doors, treat her like a queen.
