1471092088976683012	1342628613213061120	  You didn’t mention mobility disabled adults and children who now have to walk an excessive distance to get to school. Ableism at its peak right there.	2
1471091898873958401	351899460	The fact that I have after work plans really got me blown... like Sis you don't even wanna go out to work, chances of you going anywhere after work VERY SLIM	2

1470948481028300806	45482428	 Yeah… was spoiled by going to school in Scotland, if not necessarily through the school, through the national healthcare. The treatment for head wound (possibly from a fallen brick) cost nothing, though it had admittedly been too healed for stitches by the time I got to the ER.	2

1471592022461067271	2597224562	 So if a new variant emerges that is more deadly, spreads quickly, and the vaccines stop working against keep schools open because having students' family and friends die is better than students not being able to go to school to see their friends.	2
1471583652190601225	68233335	I so desperately wish I could love something else as much.

1471558581908611077	14344402	Instead of “don’t see your family and friends for Christmas despite the fact that we’ve been forcing you to go to work for at least a year in a pandemic,” how about “here’s a free packet of rapid tests, please take one before you go to parties and gatherings!”	2
1471553324096839685	2658343697	 You played on great teams do they just go out and keep doing the right things, I guess all they can do now?	2

1471348358442848259	43648402	  IMHO the biggest obstacle here is trust.
