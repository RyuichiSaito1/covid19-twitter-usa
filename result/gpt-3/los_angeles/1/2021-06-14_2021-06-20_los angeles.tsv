1406659531942240262	69132972	I used to go to school with some chick who had to take a picture every morning before leaving the house and send it to her man. If he didn’t approve of her outfit she had to change. Ay no que feo caso lol	2
1406657650633240579	1557234132	This brings up a great point - with people finding themselves going out and possibly exposed in-person to more unique items, what sets/cards could pop because they “look better in-hand” than in pics? 	0
1406527017747574789	2765450028	 Yes they have changed.  I had a student come to school with green hair. His mom said she had to give him green hair because he wanted it.

1406453697027088386	158988614	Late but if this is a toxic person you're distancing yourself from, don't. Call a best friend. Go out. Don't stay alone with your thoughts. Your body is going through a physical dependency withdrawal. Yes, it sucks and hurts but long term, you'll be thankful 💖 	0
