1424742712905846786	20252627	 I’m so sorry you had to experience this first hand, Brissia. Naming something that commonly happens often helps with gathering tools to combat it or identifying allies to help. Obviously too late this time around but hopefully you’re better armed now ❤️	2

1426183562777092106	860651911	            I agree with  - it’s fab to have Twitter Don back :) As for recognizing students…gathering around their interests might be a great start to bringing out personalities and making connections. They are individuals, but in need of a strong sense of belonging.	0

Petition gathering (a paid process) began almost immediately after Newsom’s election. It’s not about his performance, it’s a partisan effort.  So keep the votes for candidates low."	2

Fauci was asked about the 0,0 gathering vs I'm sure he was not asked about Hypocrite Obama hosting a spreader event.	2

Strive for success but don’t fear failure.But launching now is taking unnecessary risk by flying with a known valve issue. In this scenario they would be putting days of valuable data gathering time at risk.	2
