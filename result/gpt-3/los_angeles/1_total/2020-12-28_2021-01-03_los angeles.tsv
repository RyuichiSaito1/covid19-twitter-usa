1345420558154878976	160755682	   They find your address, your name, where the people you care about work/go to school and they threaten them with death and SWAT you. Its becomes more then trolling, it gets serious and blurs the lines between what is internet trash talk and what is real. This is no joke.	2
1345418514010554368	14349013	The distribution of the Covid vaccine seems to be going the way of the back-to-school debacle. It’s not like states and counties didn’t have time to create a plan. Winging it rarely works.	2
1345395228123906048	635529892	This is a huge point, and one often missed by people who want to go out and get a starter level player with the TPE. Our asset cupboard is one of the barest in the league at this point, laying out a lot for someone like Aaron Gordon will likely be all we can do for a while 	2

1345878851587428352	330799588	First kick-off of the game where it was touched before going out of bounds, spot on that 0th down, no false start call. If you're a Bears fan, STFU about Packers getting calls. 	0

1345869636277919744	1218751115107303424	I was at CVS with my grandpa and the security guard stops us as we exit to tell him he recognizes him. He had photos pulled up from Google of  him and our fam. I swear it’s a small world. Also, bein able to go out with your grandparents is a flex in itself 😅😍🥰	0
1345858087618449409	330799588	 Your dude clearly touched the ball before going out of bounds on the opening kickoff of the game, which directly led to your first score. Complain somewhere else.	0

1345838376776159233	28362942	  Not high, but it’s very possible and I’m not blaming you , it’s the system. You are observing all the protocols. 👏🏽👏🏽 unfortunately the protocols for going out lessen the probability, they don’t prevent. And our government isn’t supporting us enough for a true quarantine.	2
1345826136253558784	35512578	. can’t go out like this. Either win this for him, or get him to come back another season	2

1345808337271627776	135647869	Go out with the certainty that you gave it everything you had and didn’t hold anything back. Go out empty-handed when it comes to should-haves and could-have-beens. Because it’s an infinitely more fulfilling way to live than the alternative.	0
1345808336139108352	135647869	The last thing this world needs right now is one more indifferent person.If you’re the only one left with passion, then use it. Use the hell out of it. At the end of your life go out with a bruised up, worn out heart that gave too much and loved too strongly & felt too fiercely.	2
1345804920868356097	14303901	I think about this a lot. It’s difficult to be a Benedict Arnold type of traitor, as an American. Most of us were born into citizenship and didn’t actually have to work at it. But you have to go out of your way to *commit* treason, if you’re not a federal elected official.	2

1345792671080538112	118199480	  So you’re telling me that the parents know what’s best over scientists and doctors? Comparing it to college seasons is ridiculous because of the fact that colleges did tests everyday. Mommy and Daddy don’t test their kids everyday.	2
