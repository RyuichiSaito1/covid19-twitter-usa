1340214768674607105	14841977	 True. But has Din Dijrain had any contact with Jedi? Wouldn’t most of the Jedi have been dead by the time he was born, or at least by the time he was old enough to go out and fight in armor?I imagine that he hates Jedi the way some misguided American children hate the USSR.	2

1340795870351003648	23850184	  Interesting. They're having them take classes at the JC to avoid overcrowding but allow them to play HS sports. Might allow those who didn't do so well in distance learning to catch up on the classroom better heading to college too	2
