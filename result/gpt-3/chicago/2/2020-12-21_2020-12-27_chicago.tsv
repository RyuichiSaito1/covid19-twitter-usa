Some programs have been sending kids home all season. TOSU changed every rule so the conference can get money. messed up year.	2
1343294779883450371	24669007	  That’s Iowa’s Coach’s choice, I respect it either way. Classless is Wisconsin is when they went to a wedding and decimated the illinois team. Or Ohio State backing in to the playoff getting rules changed left and right. Again thank you for the well thought out response. God Bless	0

1341639821203267585	73569625	For the record, gathering in large groups—masked or unmasked, inside or outside—is unwise and not helpful to contain the virus and it doesn’t matter if you’re protesting for racial equality, singing in worship, etc.Wear a mask, but distance is most important.

1342386147167760385	2933640214	Note to diary or whatever the f this is; a good old boy does not do great in a city where religion/ “gang” otherwise known as groups of folks who make money together in finance are constantly following you and harassing you at every public/even private gathering. It’s asinine.	2
