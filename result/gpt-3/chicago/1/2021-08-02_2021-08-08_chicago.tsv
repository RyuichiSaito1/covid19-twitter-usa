1424030368525656071	1081175521	   I think what's SO interesting about that is is studios go cheaper ... aren't they just making Netflix quality movies? If there's no discernable difference why go out? Which compounds problem. No easy answers.	2

1424430514027614211	1182793933929234432	   Bit of a narrow viewpoint. We should ALL still be worried about COVID & no one under 0 has an option to be vaxxed yet. It’s a bit ignorant to tell their parents that they shouldn’t go out. They’ve been dealing with their own & their kids struggle during this. We can’t imagine.	2
