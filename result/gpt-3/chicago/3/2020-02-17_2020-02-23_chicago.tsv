1231015963325272064	20088570	 Sorry! Had to work and travel back home. Had the goat cheese bread (👍), the truffle pasta (yummy, but not mind blowing), winter vegetables (could’ve passed on this), and ricotta donuts (basically beignets). It was great, but not the best I’ve ever had. Excellent service.	2
